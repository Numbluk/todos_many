Multiple collections vs one collection

Lists:
- Collection of list todolist Models

Models:
- array of todos vs a model for each todo

View:
- Input View - never rerenders
- Sidebar view - rerenders on changes to addition, change, etc to any list
- Main View -

var app = {

};

Todos: Collection of lists
List: Model. Array of todo's
 - id: title name
Todo: Todo model
 - id: number based on count in containing list

When you add a todo:
  if it has a title (from ul, or submit) that is in todos (i.e. it exists):
  - find the list based on the title (it's id) in todos
  - add a new model to that list
  - rerender
  if it is not in the todos (this is a new list):
  - create a new list with title as a number
  - add a new model to that list
  - rerender

When you want to remove a todo:
- it will belong to a list
  - find that list
  - find the todo in that list and remove it

When you want to toggle the completion of a todo:
- it will belong to a list
  - find that list
  - find that todo in that list and toggle the completion

When you save/want another todo (plus-sign):
  If it does not have a title (the title is a number):
  - display and focus title input and replace placeholder text to indicate
  - add to the list and replace with a fresh list ( no list elements )

Complete all in a list
- find that list
- complete all

Delete a list
- find that list in the todos
- delete it

Extras:
- empty a list
-

Need methods attributes for display:
in todos
- count all incomplete

in each list
- number complete
- recalculates on toggle completion
